# Prompt History

A running record of the prompts that shaped this project, with the outcome of
each. New prompts are appended automatically by a `UserPromptSubmit` hook when
running under the Claude Code CLI in this repo (see `.claude/`); sessions driven
another way are reconstructed by hand — as Session 1 and Session 2 below were.

> This is a paraphrased-but-faithful log of user requests + results, not a full
> transcript. It exists so the project's *intent and history* travel with the code.

## Session 1 — 2026-07-04 (build)

1. **"Head to my repo and clone tsd-boarddocs to my Downloads folder."**
   → No exact `tsd-boarddocs` repo existed; identified `akarpo/tools-troysdboarddocs` as the only BoardDocs repo and cloned it.
2. **"Read the .md file."** → Summarized the README (local download→extract→index→retrieve pipeline).
3. **"Wondering if we can make a searchable site with an integrated RAG, large files to Cloudflare R2."** → Proposed a Cloudflare-native RAG site (Pages/Worker + Vectorize + Workers AI + R2).
4. **"Actually maybe build an MCP site (supported in Chrome 149)."** → Grounded **WebMCP** (Chrome 149 origin trial, `document.modelContext`); reframed as one retrieval core behind a website + remote MCP + WebMCP. Decisions: **both server + WebMCP page**, **open to anyone**.
5. **"I already have the board docs in R2 in folder 'troysd-boarddocs'" (R2 token pasted).** → Flagged the live credential; found bucket `media`; later determined the docs weren't actually there (silent `--remote` no-op) and re-uploaded via the pipeline.
6. **"Rename this to tsd-boarddocs on GitHub; one tool that downloads/builds a website + GitHub Actions like tsd-cotpermits."** → Renamed the repo; adopted the cot-permits pattern (one repo, Action-driven, R2 for large files).
7. **"Look at the desktop screenshot (WebMCP trial) + the .md file; does it align?"** → Answered the origin-trial form (apex origin + subdomain match, uncheck third-party, 0–10k usage); confirmed the design doc aligned; adopted `search`/`fetch` + "copy context" fallback + hybrid-search idea.
8. **(WebMCP origin-trial token pasted.)** → Decoded/verified it; wired into `index.html` `<head>`.
9. **"Wrangler is now logged in."** → Created the Vectorize index; validated the pipeline on a 2026 slice (1,742 chunks); deployed to `pages.dev`; MCP + search verified.
10. **"Is this ready to connect Pages + add the domain?"** → Yes; guided Git-connect. The Git flow created a **Worker**, not Pages → restructured the repo to Worker + Static Assets.
11. **"Where are bindings set?" / "What line to edit?" (binding-dialog screenshot).** → Confirmed it's a Worker; moved bindings into `wrangler.toml`.
12. **"It deployed successfully."** → Verified site + `/api/search` + `/mcp` live on `tsd-boarddocs.karpowitsch.org`.
13. **"'Open source PDF' gives a 404."** → Diagnosed `wrangler`'s `#`-key truncation; built the `tsd-ingest` exact-key uploader; all 278 citations fixed.
14. **"Start indexing all the old years."** → Downloaded all 346 meetings (2010–2026); ran the full extract→chunk→embed→R2 pipeline.
15. **"Refactor search results — date, meeting type, agenda position, embed PDF/PPTX/DOCX viewer, AI summaries."** → Agreed; chose **convert-to-PDF** viewing and **local, resumable summaries** with a pending-flag. Baked `meeting_type` + `agenda_item` into the chunker; built the card + PDF-viewer UI.
16. **"Use Opus 4.8 for summaries, over multiple days; monitor tokens (at ~50%)."** → Set summaries as a resumable, budget-controlled multi-day Opus task.
17. **"Build part of the UI now."** → Shipped the card redesign + inline PDF viewer + metadata passthrough (v0.3.0).
18. **"Fully document this project — multiple .md files, prompt history (captured going forward), tooling with version tracking, all on GitHub."** → This documentation set + `CHANGELOG.md` + prompt-capture hook.

## Session 2 — 2026-07-05 (D1 migration, summaries, filters, browse)

19. **"If we're doing our own summaries, why do we need Workers AI at all?"** → Dropped Workers AI + Vectorize; moved search to **D1 FTS5 / BM25** (v0.4), free tier, no neuron cap.
20. **"Proceed with the refactor for the live site."** → Shipped the D1-backed site: search join, `/api/summary`, and `/doc` serving R2 **same-origin** (fixed the cross-origin PDF embed).
21. **"What about the Opus summaries?" / "The three summaries made 10MB? No — find a technical way; it's all text."** → Corrected the framing (summaries are tiny text in D1, not a storage problem); built the `summaries` table + resumable harness; **search leverages the verbose summary** via a per-doc `sum:` row.
22. **"Do summaries for 2025–2026." / "Start with 50." / "another 100." / "another 150."** → Built batch-prep + an Opus fan-out **workflow**; generated in waves. Found + fixed a bug where `args` arrived as a JSON string (batch counts silently capped at 10).
23. **"Stop; we'll do the last 50 later." / "Complete the last batch — were all uploaded?"** → Stopped cleanly, verified every summary was stored + indexed (308; 2026 complete), finished the dropped batches.
24. **"Add a meeting-type toggle; Back should return to results; year multi-select dropdown."** → Meeting-type segmented filter + year multi-select; viewer **Back** returns to the prior results via history state + URL sync.
25. **"Put the other ~370 into a 'Special' tag, included in 'All'."** → Added the **Special** segment (`meeting_type NOT IN (Regular,Workshop)`).
26. **"What other search UX would you suggest?" / "Meeting dates should match BoardDocs + linked docs."** → Proposed the Tier-1/Tier-2 roadmap; diagnosed + fixed **130 mis-dated packet-era docs** (date+type recovered from filenames; `build_index.py` root-fixed).
27. **"Build the Tier-1 three + wire the BoardDocs deep-link."** → Document-type filter, sort (relevance/newest/oldest), group-by-meeting, and per-result **BoardDocs deep-links** (`bd_links.js`, 100% coverage).
28. **"Go tackle the Tier-2 stuff."** → Acronym/synonym expansion + the **meeting-browse timeline**; decision/outcome badges evaluated and **deferred** (vote data is motion-level in sparse minutes, not per-doc).
29. **"Summarize 30 more."** → Ran another Opus summary wave (2025).
30. **"Fix the meeting time — colon for half/quarter hours, truncate to '7PM' on the hour."** → Added `fmtTime()` across the UI.
31. **"Make sure all documentation, tooling, and .md files are updated and on GitHub."** → This refresh: README, ARCHITECTURE, OPERATIONS, **TOOLING** (new), CHANGELOG (v0.5–0.7), and this Session-2 history; stale Vectorize docstrings corrected.

QUESTION: What did the board approve for Boulan Park Middle School security and paging in July 2026, and which companies won the work?

- **(2026-08-08 12:01 UTC)** This is a REMINDER, not a task you can execute yourself. Do not attempt the uploads from this cloud session — they cannot work here. Your job is to surface a clear, actionable reminder for Alex.

BACKGROUND: On 2026-08-07 the tsd-boarddocs project exhausted the YouTube Data API daily quota (~20,600 units — seven video uploads plus about twenty caption operations). The quota resets at midnight Pacific. Twelve caption tracks were left unpushed, and one needs verifying. The site and the local transcripts are already correct; only the caption files on YouTube lag.

WHY THIS CANNOT RUN IN THE CLOUD: the push needs the YouTube OAuth credentials in tsd-secrets.env (a local file outside the repo, never committed) and the .srt deliverables in transcripts/, which is gitignored and therefore absent from any fresh clone. It must be run on Alex's Mac.

WHAT TO OUTPUT — a short reminder containing:

1. The 12 caption tracks owed:
   - Ten 2024 meetings that have NEVER been captioned (the captions manifest had no 2024 entries until v0.18.1): 2024-01-16, 2024-02-27, 2024-03-19, 2024-04-16, 2024-05-21, 2024-06-20, 2024-09-17, 2024-10-15, 2024-11-19, 2024-12-17
   - Two whose speaker attribution changed on 2026-08-07 and whose tracks still carry the old labels: 2025-10-14 and 2026-02-24

2. One track to VERIFY rather than push: 2026-05-19. It was pushed on 2026-08-07 but the output was truncated by a shell pipe, so the insert/update confirmation was never seen. Confirm via captions.list that its track exists and its lastUpdated is 2026-08-07 or later; re-push only if it is stale or missing.

3. The exact commands to run locally:

cd ~/Downloads/tsd-boarddocs
for D in 2024-01-16 2024-02-27 2024-03-19 2024-04-16 2024-05-21 2024-06-20 2024-09-17 2024-10-15 2024-11-19 2024-12-17 2025-10-14 2026-02-24; do
  python3 transcription/upload_captions.py --only "$D"
done

Each run should print 'inserted' or 'updated' — do not pipe it through tail, which is exactly how the 2026-05-19 confirmation was lost.

4. The budget: roughly 4,900 units (400 per new track, 450 per update) against a raised daily quota measured at about 20,600 units. Comfortably affordable, but do the caption pushes BEFORE any video uploads that day, since one videos.insert costs 1,600.

5. A caution: once the quota is exhausted even a 50-unit captions.list read returns 403, so verification becomes impossible until the next reset.

If the repository cloned successfully, you may read CHANGELOG.md entries v0.18.0 through v0.18.2 and transcription/upload_captions.py to confirm the twelve dates are still listed in MEETINGS, and say so. If the clone is unavailable, just deliver the reminder from the details above — do not treat that as a failure.

## Session — 2026-09-04 (2026-09-01 workshop end to end; deep links; playlists; QA pass)

Reconstructed by hand: this session ran from `~`, so the repo's `UserPromptSubmit` hook did not fire.

1. **"Please review the tsd-boarddocs project. The September 1st workshop meeting recording is now posted."** → Found TelVue media 1043840 (3:48:28). Ingested the workshop's 10 documents, wrote the three summary tiers, grew the keyterm index, downloaded and transcribed the recording (1,110 utterances, 9 clusters). Found BoardDocs had moved attachments to a `pfiles` path the crawler never matched (no deep links since August) and that the YouTube refresh token had expired.
2. **"Please pause work, I need to conserve tokens"** → Stopped with a standalone status.
3. **"Please proceed and pick up where you were interrupted, 5H window has reset"** → Named all ten speakers from transcript evidence (the API identifier got two clusters wrong), authored 22 numbered chapters, fixed the crawler regex and re-walked three meetings, numbered the 2026-08-18 chapters that had shipped bare, added `anchors/prep_meeting.py`, `anchors/coverage.py`, `scripts/gen_bd_links.py`; committed and pushed.
4. **(Asked how to handle the dead YouTube token; chose "Drive it in Chrome for me")** → Re-minted the refresh token through the browser consent, uploaded the video as `3pJjVfmMOT4`, loaded transcript/anchors/captions, pushed both descriptions, verified chapters render after processing.
5. **"Check to see if 5H reset, it should have, I just upgraded to 20x"** → Read the usage snapshot: reset confirmed.
6. **"Please perform a documentation and QA pass"** → Stale counts and claims updated across the docs; D1 integrity checks clean (no duplicate chunk ids, 3,311 docs = 3,311 summaries); found the two recent videos missing from the 2026 playlist, wrote `transcription/playlists.py`, and found three duplicate 2024 uploads sitting in that playlist (deduped); fixed the coverage gate's anchored test; reconstructed this entry.
7. **"Please see the facebook post … and create a post for the September 1st meeting as a .docx on the desktop"** (+ "also see the reply to the post, which has the whole timestamp and agenda section") → Read the Aug 18 post's format in the group, wrote the Sept 1 notes and the timestamped-agenda reply to `~/Desktop/TSD Board Workshop Notes 2026-09-01.docx`.
