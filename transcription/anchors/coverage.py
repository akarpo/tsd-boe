"""For each agenda item, did the board actually discuss it -- and if not, why not?

Omitting an item from the chapter list is only correct if the item genuinely was
not discussed. This checks that claim against the transcript instead of assuming
it: every agenda item is searched for by its own distinctive words (RFP numbers,
proper nouns, content words), and the verdict says whether it was DISCUSSED (a
cluster of mentions), MENTIONED (in passing -- typically swept through the consent
agenda), or ABSENT (no trace at all, i.e. tabled or pulled).
