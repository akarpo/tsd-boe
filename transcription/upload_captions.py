"""Batch-upload the speaker-attributed .srt caption tracks to the existing YouTube videos.

Uses the YouTube Data API v3 (captions.insert / captions.update — 400/450 quota
units each; the 12-meeting batch fits the 10,000/day default easily). Captions
require OAuth as the channel owner, via the TV/limited-input device flow:

One-time setup (≈5 min):
  1. console.cloud.google.com → create/select a project → "APIs & Services" →
     enable **YouTube Data API v3**.
  2. OAuth consent screen → External → Testing → add your Google account as a
     test user (no app verification needed for personal use).
  3. Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID → application type
     **"Desktop app"** → copy the client ID and secret into tsd-secrets.env as
     YT_CLIENT_ID / YT_CLIENT_SECRET. (Device-flow/TV clients can't carry the
     captions scope — Google's device flow rejects youtube.force-ssl.)
  4. Run this script: it prints an accounts.google.com URL and listens on
     127.0.0.1:8765; approve in the browser once and the refresh token is
     appended to tsd-secrets.env for next time.

Usage:  python3 transcription/upload_captions.py [--dry-run] [--only 2026-06-16]
Re-runs update the existing track instead of duplicating it.

AUDIT FIRST — this script reports what it uploaded, never what it was supposed to.
Before spending upload quota, ask the API which videos actually lack the track
(captions.list is 50 units vs insert's 400, so auditing all ~41 costs ~5 uploads).
On 2026-08-08 a remembered owed-list of 12 was wrong both ways: 2 had already
landed before an earlier 403, and 5 more had never been captioned at all. See
"Audit before you push captions" in docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md for the snippet.

Quota: ~41 list calls + 15 inserts exhausted the day. Run any verification sweep
BEFORE the uploads, or wait for the reset (midnight Pacific / 3am Eastern).

TITLE_BY_VID below is a FILENAME map, not a title map — it only derives the local
.srt path. An entry disagreeing with the file on disk makes this script print
"MISSING <name>.srt" and skip that video silently rather than fail. Copy titles
from manifest_<year>.json's `title` field, which records the real channel title.
