# ingest_meeting.sh — pull new BoardDocs meetings into D1 + R2, then prep summaries.
#
# Wraps the six-step incremental ingest so the two things that silently ruin a run
# can't be forgotten:
#
#   1. --skip-ingested on the crawl. The crawler's normal skip test is "is the
#      meeting folder already on disk", which is useless on a fresh corpus — it
#      would re-download the whole window and BoardDocs would rate-limit you
#      partway through. --skip-ingested also skips whatever is already in D1.
#   2. R2 before D1. upload_cloudflare.py --new-only decides what to push by
#      asking D1 and treats "already in D1" as "already in R2", so loading D1
#      first makes every new document look uploaded: R2 gets nothing and the
#      viewer 404s on documents search can find.
#
# Summaries are NOT generated here — that needs Claude Opus. This preps the batch
# files and prints the remaining two steps.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ingest_meeting.sh [START_DATE] [options]
#
#   The ingest-worker secret is read by tsd_secrets.py (env var, else the
#   secrets file outside the repo) — no longer passed on the command line.
#
#   START_DATE     YYYY-MM-DD; only meetings on or after it. Default: 45 days ago.
#   --dry-run      List what would be downloaded, then stop. No secret needed.
#   --no-prep      Skip the summary batch prep (ingest only).
#   -h, --help     This message.
#
# Env: TSD_BOE_ROOT (corpus root, default <repo>/data/tsd-boe-data)
#      TSD_BATCH_DIR (default /tmp/tsd_batches), TSD_OUT_DIR (default /tmp/tsd_out)
#      BD_BROWSER (auto|always|never) — headless-Chrome fallback when BoardDocs
#        blocks the plain HTTP client; passed through to download_troysd.py
