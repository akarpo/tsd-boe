"""Grow the speech-to-text keyterm index from each meeting's own packet, with provenance.

Why this exists
---------------
`proper_nouns.py` rebuilds a keyterm list from the whole corpus and keeps the top
40 firms. That has two failure modes, and the 2026-08-18 meeting hit both.

1. **The cap is ours, not the API's.** AssemblyAI's `keyterms_prompt` takes 1,000
   phrases; we were sending 361. The 40-firm ceiling evicted five firms to admit
   five others on a routine refresh, so a name could be in the vocabulary one
   month and gone the next for no reason connected to whether anyone says it.
2. **Whole-corpus ranking buries the meeting you are about to transcribe.** The
   vocabulary that matters for one recording is the vocabulary in that meeting's
   packet, and a first-time vendor ranks last against fifteen years of history.

So this indexes *forward*: before a meeting is transcribed, read its packet, take
the proper nouns, and union them into a persistent index. Terms are never evicted
— an index that forgets is worse than useless for a recurring vendor — and each
carries when it arrived and what brought it in.

The index is deliberately seeded per meeting rather than bulk-loaded from the
corpus. Adding all 463 firms ever named would fit the API budget and would still
be wrong: most are one-off payees who will never be spoken aloud, and the point is
a vocabulary of terms that recur.
