# tsd-boarddocs

A searchable, AI-queryable archive of every public Troy School District (Michigan)
Board of Education document. It ingests BoardDocs, builds a full-text index, adds
AI summaries, and serves it three ways from one Cloudflare Worker:

1. **A search website** — [tsd-boarddocs.karpowitsch.org](https://tsd-boarddocs.karpowitsch.org)
2. **A remote MCP connector** (`/mcp`) — add it to Claude, ChatGPT, etc.; their
   agent answers questions using the `search` / `fetch` tools.
3. **WebMCP** — Chrome 149+ browser agents auto-discover the same `search`/`fetch`
   tools while on the page (via `document.modelContext`, origin-trial).

Retrieval runs on your infrastructure; **the visitor's own AI does the
generation**, so there's no per-answer LLM cost. The whole system runs on
Cloudflare's **free tier** (D1 + R2 + Workers).

## What you can do

- **Full-text search** (D1 FTS5 / BM25) over ~3,300 documents (2010–2026) with
  filters: meeting type (Regular / Workshop / Special), document type
  (Resolution / Financial / Budget / Policy / Presentation / Contract / Other),
  year (multi-select), and sort (relevance / newest / oldest). Board acronyms
  (RIF, IEP, ISD, CTE, …) expand automatically to their full phrases and back.
- **AI summaries** — three tiers per document (paragraph / single-page / verbose),
  generated locally with **Claude Opus**. The verbose summary is indexed as a
  per-document search row, so a doc can surface on its clean summary text; a pill
  toggle in the viewer switches tiers.
- **Group by meeting** and a **📅 meeting-browse timeline** (year → meeting → its
  full document set, in agenda order).
- **Meeting recordings with searchable, speaker-attributed transcripts** — a
  meeting page embeds its YouTube recording with agenda-item chapter chips and a
  full transcript (real names, not "Speaker A"); clicking any chapter or
  transcript line seeks the video to that moment. Transcripts are produced with
  AssemblyAI boosted by a district proper-noun vocabulary mined from this
  archive, and the same SRTs are uploaded to YouTube as caption tracks. Coverage:
  the 2024, 2025 and 2026 seasons — every recording located on the channel is
  transcribed, audited against its minutes, and carries a speaker-attributed
  caption track — see [docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md](docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md).
- **Ask the Archive** (`/ask`) — a registration-gated AI Q&A over the corpus
  (owner-approved accounts, passwordless one-time-code sign-in, human-moderated
  questions, answered by a local Claude Code runner) — see
  [assistant/README.md](assistant/README.md).
- **Inline document viewer** (same-origin PDF) with a **"View on BoardDocs"**
  deep-link to the source meeting agenda.

## Architecture

```
INGEST (Python — run locally; incremental on re-run)
  download_troysd.py           BoardDocs -> $TSD_BOE_ROOT/<meeting>/<file>
  extract_all.py               PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/RTF -> _text/<meeting>/<file>.txt
  build_index.py               chunk (~800 tok) -> _index/chunks.jsonl   (torch-free)
  upload_d1.py [--new-only]    chunks -> D1 (FTS5) via the ingest worker
  upload_cloudflare.py --r2 [--new-only]   source docs -> R2 (exact-key PUT)
  scripts/convert_office.py    DOCX/PPTX -> preview PDF in R2 (LibreOffice)
  summarize.py + scripts/summaries_workflow.js   Opus 3-tier summaries -> D1 (local only)

SERVE (Cloudflare Worker — worker.js)
  /api/search              q (+ filters, sort) -> D1 FTS5/BM25 -> ranked, de-duped docs
  /api/fetch               id -> full passage text
  /api/summary             url -> the three summary tiers
  /api/meetings /api/meeting   the browse timeline
  /api/recording           date+name -> YouTube id + agenda chapters + transcript
  /doc                     key -> R2 object, served same-origin (PDF viewer)
  /mcp                     remote MCP (search/fetch tools)
  else                     static site from public/

DATA
  D1 database "tsd-boarddocs"  — chunks (FTS5) + summaries
                                 + recordings / transcript_utts / transcript_anchors; free tier
  R2 media/troysd-boarddocs/   — source PDFs, public at media.karpowitsch.org
```

Search is **keyword/BM25 over D1**, not embeddings — the corpus is dense with IDs,
proper nouns, and dollar amounts, and we generate our own summaries, so full-text
search fits better and stays on the free tier (no Workers AI neuron cap). Workers
AI + Vectorize were dropped in v0.4.

## Scripts / tooling

Full inventory + status in **[docs/TOOLING.md](docs/TOOLING.md)**. The active pipeline:

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `download_troysd.py` | Crawls TroySD BoardDocs; saves every public file under `<YYYY-MM-DD>_<meeting>/`. Incremental — skips meetings already on disk, plus (with `--skip-ingested`) any already in D1. BoardDocs rate-limits bulk crawling, so keep re-crawls small. |
| `extract_all.py` | PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/RTF → `.txt` mirrors in `_text/`. |
| `build_index.py` | Token-windowed chunking → `_index/chunks.jsonl` (sha1 ids, R2 urls, meeting/agenda metadata; recovers packet-era dates from filenames). |
| `upload_d1.py` | Loads `chunks.jsonl` into D1 via the ingest worker's `/d1insert` (parameterized batches). `--new-only` uploads just the docs not already in D1. |
| `upload_cloudflare.py --r2` | Uploads source docs to R2 (exact-key PUT, parallel); `--new-only` for just-new docs. `--vectors` is deprecated (Vectorize gone). |
| `scripts/convert_office.py` | DOCX/PPTX → preview PDF in R2 via LibreOffice (resumable). |
| `summarize.py` | Opus summary harness: `--stats`, `--prep-batches N`, `--store-dir`. Resumable via a D1 "pending" flag. |
| `scripts/summaries_workflow.js` | Multi-agent Opus fan-out (one agent per prepped batch file). |
| `bd_links.js` | Generated map (from `boarddocs_unids.json`) of doc → BoardDocs meeting UNID for deep-links; bundled into the worker. |
| `scripts/ingest_meeting.sh` | **Adding a new meeting** — wraps the whole incremental ingest in the right order and preps summary batches. `scripts/ingest_meeting.sh --dry-run` to preview. |
| `verify_unids.py` | Drift check that the BoardDocs identifiers still resolve. Run on demand. |
| `transcription/transcribe_meeting.py` | Meeting video → AssemblyAI transcript (proper-noun keyterms + diarization) → speaker-name attribution. ~$0.40/meeting. See [docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md](docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md). |
| `transcription/upload_transcript.py` | Attributed transcript + YouTube id + agenda-item anchors → D1, powering the meeting page's recording section. |

## Data layout

Everything the pipeline produces lives under the checkout; `.gitignore` decides
what reaches GitHub, rather than the folder it happens to sit in.

```
tsd-boarddocs/
  data/                      gitignored — bulk, local, rebuildable
    tsd-boe-data/            $TSD_BOE_ROOT: corpus + _text/ + _index/chunks.jsonl (~3.7 GB)
    backups/                 chunk / summary / pre-2020 text snapshots
  resummarize/               re-summarization campaigns
    *_manifest.json          committed
    <campaign>_out/          committed — agent output; the queue's resume state
    stores/<campaign>/       committed — the payloads pushed to D1
    <campaign>/              gitignored — batch text, regenerable from manifest + corpus
```

Source PDFs live in R2; searchable data + summaries live in D1. The corpus is
disposable — losing it costs a re-crawl, nothing more.

Secrets and the ingest Worker stay **outside** the repo in
`~/Downloads/tsd-boarddocs-keysandsupportingfiles/`, because that Worker holds an
inline secret; see [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md#the-support-folder-keys--ingest-worker).

## Deploy

A **Cloudflare Worker with static assets**, deployed by connecting the repo in the
Cloudflare dashboard (push to `main` → build). `wrangler.toml` supplies the entry
point (`worker.js`), the assets dir (`public/`), and the `DB` (D1) + `MEDIA` (R2)
bindings — no manual dashboard binding needed. (Cloudflare's Git flow creates a
*Worker*, not Pages; a Pages-style `wrangler.toml` fails with "Missing entry-point".)

```bash
git push                    # triggers the Worker build
wrangler deploy --dry-run   # local validation without deploying
```

## Requirements (ingest)

Python 3.10+ with `requests pypdf pdfplumber python-docx python-pptx openpyxl
striprtf tiktoken`, plus `wrangler` (npm). LibreOffice (`soffice` on PATH) only for
the DOCX/PPTX→PDF viewer conversion. No ML libraries.

## Source data

All documents are public, from <https://go.boarddocs.com/mi/troysd/Board.nsf>.
This repo only fetches, indexes, summarizes, and serves them. Independent
project — not affiliated with Troy School District.
